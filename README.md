# temperature_converter
Web tool developed with React to convert temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to run this app in your machine, do the following:

1. Clone this repository or download the code as a zip file and decompress it in your machine.
2. To inspect the source code, open the new folder that should have been created (root folder) in Visual Studio Code or in the IDE of your choice.
3. Run the command **_npm i_** from a terminal to download and install all the necessary dependencies for executing both the application and the tests.
4. Once everything is installed, run the command **_npm start_** from a terminal, which will launch the app and will open a new window in your default browser to show it. If that window is not automatically opened, you have to navigate to the url **_http://localhost:3000_**.
5. To use the app, simply type in the Celsius input field or Fahrenheit input field the value you want to convert from, and the result will automatically appear in the other field. Only numbers are allowed, so if you enter an invalid value, the result of the conversion will be an empty field.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
